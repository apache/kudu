# Some of the older code uses 'Foo *bar' instead of 'Foo* bar'. But,
# for new code, we want to switch to the latter formatting regardless
# of what the rest of the file uses.

# We prefer to put arguments and parameters on separate lines when they
# don't fit on one line, rather than bin-packing them into as few lines
