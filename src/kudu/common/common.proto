  //     write transactions to complete.
  // More specifically, the server will choose the latest timestamp higher than

  // timestamp will be returned back to the client as 'snapshot timestamp'. The Kudu
  // client library will use it as the propagated timestamp for subsequent reads
  // to avoid unnecessarily waiting.
