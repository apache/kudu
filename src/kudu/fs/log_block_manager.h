// A log-backed (i.e. sequentially allocated file) block storage
// implementation.
//
// This is a block storage implementation that attempts to reduce the
// number of files used by clustering blocks into large files known
// henceforth as containers. A container begins empty and is written to
// sequentially, block by block. When a container becomes full, it is set
// aside and a new container is created.
//
// Implementation details
// ----------------------
//
// A container is comprised of two parts, one for metadata and one for
// data. During a write, the block's data is written as-is to the data file.
// After the block has been synchronized, a small record is written to the
// metadata part containing the block's ID and its location within the data
// file.
//
// Block deletions are handled similarly. When a block is deleted, a record
// is written describing the deletion, orphaning the old block data. The
// orphaned data can be reclaimed instantaneously via hole punching, or
// later via garbage collection. The latter is used when hole punching is
// not supported on the filesystem, or on next boot if there's a crash
// after deletion but before hole punching.
//
// Data and metadata operations are carefully ordered to ensure the
// correctness of the persistent representation at all times. During the
// writable block lifecycle (i.e. when a block is being created), data
// operations come before metadata operations. In the event that a metadata
// operation fails, the result is an orphaned block that is detected and
// pruned in the next garbage collection cycle. Conversely, metadata
// operations precede the data operations when deleting a block. In the
// worst case, a failure in the latter yields more garbage data that can be
// deleted in a GC.
//
// Care is taken to keep the in-memory representation of the block manager
// in sync with its persistent representation. To wit, a block is only made
// available in memory if _all_ on-disk operations (including any necessary
// synchronization calls) are successful.
//
// Writes to containers are batched together through the use of block
// transactions: each writer will take ownership of an "available" container,
// write a block to the container, and release ownership of the container once
// the writer "finalizes" the block, making the container available to other
// writers. This can happen concurrently; multiple transactions can interleave
// writes to single container, provided each writer finalizes its block before
// the next writer reaches for a container. Once any of the writers is
// completely done with its IO, it can commit its transaction, syncing its
// blocks and the container to disk (potentially as others are writing!).
//
// In order to maintain on-disk consistency, if the above commit fails, the
// entire container is marked read-only, and any future writes to the container
// will fail. There is a tradeoff here to note--having concurrent writers
// grants better utilization for each container; however a failure to sync by
// any of the writers will cause the others to fail and potentially corrupt the
// underlying container.
//
// When a new block is created, a container is selected from the data
// directory group appropriate for the block, as indicated by hints in
// provided CreateBlockOptions (i.e. blocks for diskrowsets should be placed
// within its tablet's data directory group).
//
// All log block manager metadata requests are served from memory. When an
// existing block manager is opened, all on-disk container metadata is
// parsed to build a single in-memory map describing the existence and
// locations of various blocks. Each entry in the map consumes ~64 bytes,
// putting the memory overhead at ~610 MB for 10 million blocks.
//
// New blocks are placed on a filesystem block boundary, and the size of
// hole punch requests is rounded up to the nearest filesystem block size.
// Taken together, this guarantees that hole punching can actually reclaim
// disk space (instead of just zeroing the block's bytes on disk).
//
// Design trade-offs
// -----------------
// In general, log-backed block storage is optimized for sustained reads
// and writes. The idea is that all blocks in a given container contain
// related data and are generally read at once, reducing seeks for
// sustained scans. This comes at a cost: the containers need to be garbage
// collected every now and then, though newer systems can take advantage of
// filesystem hole punching (as described above) to reclaim space.
//
// The default container placement policy favors simplicity over
// performance. In the future, locality hints will ensure that blocks
// pertaining to similar data are colocated, improving scan performance.
//
// The choice to serve all metadata requests from memory favors simplicity
// over memory consumption. With a very large number of blocks, the
// in-memory map may balloon in size and some sort of "spilling" behavior
// may be beneficial.

// TODO
// ----
// - Implement garbage collection fallback for hole punching.
// - Implement locality hints so that specific containers can be used for
//   groups of blocks (i.e. an entire column).
// - Implement failure recovery (i.e. metadata truncation and other
//   similarly recoverable errors).
// - Evaluate and implement a solution for data integrity (e.g. per-block
//   checksum).
// - Change the availability semantics to only mark a container as available if
//   the current writer has committed and synced its transaction.
