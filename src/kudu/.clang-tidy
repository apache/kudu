#
# 'llvm-include-order'
#
# IWYU has specific rules for ordering '-inl.h' include files, i.e.
# 'header.h' and its 'header-inl.h' counterpart. It seems in some cases
# including 'header-inl.h' before 'header.h' might even lead to compilation
# failures. So, IWYU intentionally re-orders them even if 'header-inl.h'
# comes before 'header.h' lexicographically in default C locale:
#   https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/ \
#     89ce529e945731c48445db4a6f8af11f9f905aab/build-support/iwyu/ \
#     fix_includes.py#L1786-L1787
#
# That ordering contradicts with what clang-tidy recommends when using the
# 'llvm-include-order' check.
#
# TODO(aserbin): clarify whether it's possible to customize clang-tidy
#                behavior w.r.t. the sorting of such header files using
#                the format style options described at
#                https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html
#
# 'readability-magic-numbers'
#
# Although useful in production code, we use magic numbers liberally in
# tests, and many would be net less clear as named constants.
#
# 'misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes'
#
# There are two problems with this diagnostic in the Kudu codebase:
# 1. structs containing nothing but public data members. Permitted by the Google
#    Style Guide (GSG) and used liberally in Kudu. We could set
#    IgnoreClassesWithAllMemberVariablesBeingPublic to ignore them.
# 2. protected data members. Nominally prohibited, there's a necessary exception
#    for test fixtures, and that is used extensively in Kudu. Unfortunately
#    there's no way to customize that aspect of the diagnostic, so we must
#    disable the entire thing to avoid a deluge of false positives.
