# libunwind uses some double-checked locking which isn't perfectly safe.
# Reported at http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?42677
#
# With TSAN in clang 3.5, it's the init() function that's flagged as a data
# race (not local_addr_space_init()), due to the former calling sigfillset()
# on an unprotected global variable. Although init() calls local_addr_space_init(),
# it can sometimes be eliminated from the call stack by inlining or a tail-call
# optimization, so adding the suppression on both is necessary.

# libev uses some lock-free synchronization, but doesn't have TSAN annotations.

# TSAN complains about data races on the global signals variable in
# ev_feed_signal and spoiled errno in ev_sighandler. Both are probably noise.

# See https://github.com/google/glog/issues/80 for a general list of TSAN
# issues in glog.
# 1. glog's fatal signal handler isn't signal-safe -- it allocates memory.
#    This isn't great, but nothing we can do about it. See
#    https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/issues/detail?id=191
# 2. LOG(FATAL) from multiple threads can also end up triggering a TSAN error.
# 3. g_now_entering in stacktrace_libunwind-inl.h is reset to false without
#    a Release_Store.
# 4. glog's ANNOTATE_BENIGN_RACE macro doesn't do anything.
# 5. Mutex::is_safe_ is accessed in an unsafe way.
# 6. vlocal__ is access in an unsafe way at every VLOG() or VLOG_IS_ON()
#    call-site.

# gflags variables are accessed without synchronization, but FlagSaver and other
# APIs acquire locks when accessing them. This should be safe on x86 for
# primitive flag types, but not for string flags, which is why fLS is omitted.

# This method in Boost's UUID library operates on static state with impunity,
# triggering (harmless) data races in TSAN when boost::uuids::random_generator
# instances are created across threads (see kudu::ObjectIdGenerator).

# Squeasel uses ctx->stop_flag to synchronize stopping. It always sets it with
# the context lock held, but sometimes reads it without the context lock. This
# should be safe on x86, but is nonetheless flagged by TSAN.
race:sq_stop

# Squeasel reads and frees ctx->listening_sockets without taking any locks. This
# may be an unsafe race.
