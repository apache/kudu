<h1>Apache Kudu Schema Design</h1>
      <div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu tables have a structured data model similar to tables in a traditional
RDBMS. Schema design is critical for achieving the best performance and operational
stability from Kudu. Every workload is unique, and there is no single schema design
that is best for every table. This document outlines effective schema design
philosophies for Kudu, paying particular attention to where they differ from
approaches used for traditional RDBMS schemas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a high level, there are three concerns in Kudu schema design:
<a href="#column-design">column design</a>, <a href="#primary-keys">primary keys</a>, and
<a href="#data-distribution">data distribution</a>. Of these, only data distribution will
be a new concept for those familiar with traditional relational databases. The
next sections discuss <a href="#alter-schema">altering the schema</a> of an existing table,
and <a href="#known-limitations">known limitations</a> with regard to schema design.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_perfect_schema"><a class="link" href="#_the_perfect_schema">The Perfect Schema</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The perfect schema would accomplish the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data would be distributed in such a way that reads and writes are spread evenly
across tablet servers. This is impacted by the partition schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablets would grow at an even, predictable rate and load across tablets would remain
steady over time. This is most impacted by the partition schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scans would read the minimum amount of data necessary to fulfill a query. This
is impacted mostly by primary key design, but partition design also plays a
role via partition pruning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The perfect schema depends on the characteristics of your data, what you need to do
with it, and the topology of your cluster. Schema design is the single most important
thing within your control to maximize the performance of your Kudu cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="primary-keys"><a class="link" href="#primary-keys">Primary Keys</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Kudu table must declare a primary key comprised of one or more columns.
Primary key columns must be non-nullable, and may not be a boolean or
floating-point type. Every row in a table must have a unique set of values for
its primary key columns. As with a traditional RDBMS, primary key
selection is critical to ensuring performant database operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike an RDBMS, Kudu does not provide an auto-incrementing column feature, so
the application must always provide the full primary key during insert or
ingestion. In addition, Kudu does not allow the primary key values of a row to
be updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within a tablet, rows are stored sorted lexicographically by primary key. Advanced
schema designs can take advantage of this ordering to achieve good distribution of
data among tablets, while retaining consistent ordering in intra-tablet scans. See
<a href="#data-distribution">Data Distribution</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="data-distribution"><a class="link" href="#data-distribution">Data Distribution</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu tables, unlike traditional relational tables, are partitioned into tablets
and distributed across many tablet servers. A row always belongs to a single
tablet (and its replicas). The method of assigning rows to tablets is specified
in a configurable <em>partition schema</em> for each table, during table creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choosing a data distribution strategy requires you to understand the data model and
expected workload of a table. For write-heavy workloads, it is important to
design the distribution such that writes are spread across tablets in order to
avoid overloading a single tablet. For workloads involving many short scans, performance
can be improved if all of the data for the scan is located in the same
tablet. Understanding these fundamental trade-offs is central to designing an effective
partition schema.</p>

<div class="title">No Default Partitioning</div>

Kudu does not provide a default partitioning strategy when creating tables. It
is strongly recommended to ensure that new tables have at least as many tablets
as tablet servers (but Kudu can support many tablets per tablet server).
===

</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu provides two types of partition schema: <a href="#range-partitioning">range partitioning</a> and
<a href="#hash-bucketing">hash bucketing</a>. These schema types can be <a href="#hash-and-range">used
together</a> or independently. Kudu does not yet allow tablets to be split after
creation, so you must design your partition schema ahead of time to ensure that
a sufficient number of tablets are created.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="range-partitioning"><a class="link" href="#range-partitioning">Range Partitioning</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With range partitioning, rows are distributed into tablets using a totally-ordered
distribution key. Each tablet is assigned a contiguous segment of the table&#8217;s
distribution keyspace. Tables may be range partitioned on any subset of the
primary key columns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During table creation, tablet boundaries are specified as a sequence of <em>split
rows</em>. Consider the following table schema (using SQL syntax for clarity):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE customers (last_name STRING NOT NULL,
                        first_name STRING NOT NULL,
                        order_count INT32)
PRIMARY KEY (last_name, first_name)
DISTRIBUTE BY RANGE (last_name, first_name);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifying the split rows as <code>(("b", ""), ("c", ""), ("d", ""), .., ("z", ""))</code>
(25 split rows total) will result in the creation of 26 tablets, with each
tablet containing a range of customer surnames all beginning with a given letter.
This is an effective partition schema for a workload where customers are inserted
and updated uniformly by last name, and scans are typically performed over a range
of surnames.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may make sense to partition a table by range using only a subset of the
primary key columns, or with a different ordering than the primary key. For
instance, you can change the above example to specify that the range partition
should only include the <code>last_name</code> column. In that case, Kudu would guarantee that all
customers with the same last name would fall into the same tablet, regardless of
the provided split rows.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="range-partition-management"><a class="link" href="#range-partition-management">Range Partition Management</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu 0.10 introduces the ability to specify bounded range partitions during
table creation, and the ability add and drop range partitions on the fly. This is
a good strategy for data which is always increasing, such as timestamps, or for
categorical data, such as geographic regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, during table creation, bounded range partitions can be
added for the regions 'US-EAST', 'US-WEST', and 'EUROPE'. If you attempt to insert a
row with a region that does not match an existing range partition, the insertion will
fail. Later, when a new region is needed it can be efficiently added as part of an
<code>ALTER TABLE</code> operation. This feature is particularly useful for timeseries data,
since it allows new range partitions for the current period to be added as
needed, and old partitions covering historical periods to be dropped if
necessary.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="hash-bucketing"><a class="link" href="#hash-bucketing">Hash Bucketing</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hash bucketing distributes rows by hash value into one of many buckets. Each
tablet is responsible for the rows falling into a single bucket. The number of
buckets (and therefore tablets), is specified during table creation. Typically,
all of the primary key columns are used as the columns to hash, but as with range
partitioning, any subset of the primary key columns can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hash partitioning is an effective strategy to increase the amount of parallelism
for workloads that would otherwise skew writes into a small number of tablets.
Consider the following table schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE metrics (
  host STRING NOT NULL,
  metric STRING,
  time UNIXTIME_MICROS NOT NULL,
  measurement DOUBLE,
  PRIMARY KEY (time, metric, host),
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use range partitioning over the primary key columns, inserts will
tend to only go to the tablet covering the current time, which limits the
maximum write throughput to the throughput of a single tablet. If you use hash
partitioning, you can guarantee a number of parallel writes equal to the number
of buckets specified when defining the partition schema. The trade-off is that a
scan over a single time range now must touch each of these tablets, instead of
(possibly) a single tablet. Hash bucketing can be an effective tool for mitigating
other types of write skew as well, such as monotonically increasing values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an advanced optimization, you can create a table with more than one
hash bucket component, as long as the column sets included in each are disjoint,
and all hashed columns are part of the primary key. The total number of tablets
created will be the product of the hash bucket counts. For example, the above
<code>metrics</code> table could be created with two hash bucket components, one over the
<code>time</code> column with 4 buckets, and one over the <code>metric</code> and <code>host</code> columns with
8 buckets. The total number of tablets will be 32. The advantage of using two
separate hash bucket components is that scans which specify equality constraints
on the <code>metric</code> and <code>host</code> columns will be able to skip 7/8 of the total
tablets, leaving a total of just 4 tablets to scan.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="hash-and-range"><a class="link" href="#hash-and-range">Hash Bucketing and Range Partitioning</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hash bucketing can be combined with range partitioning. Adding hash bucketing to
a range partitioned table has the effect of parallelizing operations that would
otherwise operate sequentially over the range. The total number of tablets is
the product of the number of hash buckets and the number of split rows plus one.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="alter-schema"><a class="link" href="#alter-schema">Schema Alterations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can alter a table&#8217;s schema in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rename the table</p>

<p>Kudu takes advantage of strongly-typed columns and a columnar on-disk storage
format to provide efficient encoding and serialization. To make the most of these
features, columns must be specified as the appropriate type, rather than
simulating a 'schemaless' table using string or binary columns for data which
may otherwise be structured. In addition to encoding, Kudu optionally allows
compression to be specified on a per-column basis.</p>
