<h1>Apache Kudu Prior Version Release Notes</h1>
      <div class="sect1">
<h2 id="rn_0.10.0"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0">Release notes specific to 0.10.0</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu 0.10.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations,
detailed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu 0.10.0 maintains wire-compatibility with previous releases, meaning
that applications using the Kudu client libraries may be upgraded either
before, at the same time, or after the Kudu servers. However, if you begin
using new features of Kudu 0.10.0 such as manually range-partitioned tables,
you must first upgrade all clients to this release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release does not maintain full Java API or ABI compatibility with
Kudu 0.9.x due to a package rename and some other small changes. See below for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

changes between 0.9.1 and 0.10.0</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To upgrade to Kudu 0.10.0, see <a href="#rn_0.10.0_upgrade">Upgrading from 0.9.x to 0.10.0</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes">Incompatible changes and deprecated APIs in 0.10.0</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3737">Gerrit #3737</a> The Java client has been repackaged
under <code>org.apache.kudu</code> instead of <code>org.kududb</code>. Import statements for Kudu classes must
be modified in order to compile against 0.10.0. Wire compatibility is maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/">Gerrit #3055</a> The Java client&#8217;s
synchronous API methods now throw <code>KuduException</code> instead of <code>Exception</code>.
Existing code that catches <code>Exception</code> should still compile, but introspection of an
exception&#8217;s message may be impacted. This change was made to allow thrown exceptions to be
queried more easily using <code>KuduException.getStatus</code> and calling one of <code>Status&#8217;s methods.
For example, an operation that tries to delete a table that doesn&#8217;t exist would return a
`Status</code> that returns true when queried on <code>isNotFound()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s <code>KuduTable.getTabletsLocations</code> set of methods is now
deprecated. Additionally, they now take an exclusive end partition key instead
of an inclusive key. Applications are encouraged to use the scan tokens API
instead of these methods in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ API for specifying split points on range-partitioned tables has been improved
to make it easier for callers to properly manage the ownership of the provided rows.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>TableCreator::split_rows</code> API took a <code>vector&lt;const KuduPartialRow*&gt;</code>, which
  made it very difficult for the calling application to do proper error handling with
  cleanup when setting the fields of the <code>KuduPartialRow</code>. This API has been now been
  deprecated and replaced by a new method <code>TableCreator::add_range_split</code> which allows
  easier use of smart pointers for safe memory management.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s internal buffering has been reworked. Previously, the number of
buffered write operations was constrained on a per-tablet-server basis. Now, the configured
maximum buffer size constrains the total number of buffered operations across all
tablet servers in the cluster. This provides a more consistent bound on the memory
usage of the client regardless of the size of the cluster to which it is writing.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This change can negatively affect the write performance of Java clients which rely on
  buffered writes. Consider using the <code>setMutationBufferSpace</code> API to increase a
  session&#8217;s maximum buffer size if write performance seems to be degraded after upgrading
  to Kudu 0.10.0.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "remote bootstrap" process used to copy a tablet replica from one host to
another has been renamed to "Tablet Copy". This resulted in the renaming of
several RPC metrics. Any users previously explicitly fetching or monitoring metrics
related to Remote Bootstrap should update their scripts to reflect the new names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SparkSQL datasource for Kudu no longer supports mode <code>Overwrite</code>. Users should
use the new <code>KuduContext.upsertRows</code> method instead. Additionally, inserts using the
datasource are now upserts by default. The older behavior can be restored by setting
the <code>operation</code> parameter to <code>insert</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_new_features"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_new_features">New features</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table.
When a table is created, the user may specify a set of range partitions that
do not cover the entire available key space. A user may add or drop range
partitions to existing tables.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature can be particularly helpful with time series workloads in which
  new partitions can be created on an hourly or daily basis. Old partitions
  may be efficiently dropped if the application does not need to retain historical
  data past a certain point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature is considered experimental for the 0.10 release. More details of
  the new feature can be found in the accompanying
  <a href="https://kudu.apache.org/2016/08/23/new-range-partitioning-features.html">blog post</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for running Kudu clusters with multiple masters has been stabilized.
Users may start a cluster with three or five masters to provide fault tolerance
despite a failure of one or two masters, respectively.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that certain tools (e.g. <code>ksck</code>) are still lacking complete support for
  multiple masters. These deficiencies will be addressed in a following release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now supports the ability to reserve a certain amount of free disk space
in each of its configured data directories. If a directory&#8217;s free disk space
drops to less than the configured minimum, Kudu will stop writing to that
directory until space becomes available. If no space is available in any
configured directory, Kudu will abort.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature may be configured using the <code>fs_data_dirs_reserved_bytes</code> and
  <code>fs_wal_dir_reserved_bytes</code> flags.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spark integration&#8217;s <code>KuduContext</code> now supports four new methods for writing to
Kudu tables: <code>insertRows</code>, <code>upsertRows</code>, <code>updateRows</code>, and <code>deleteRows</code>. These are
now the preferred way to write to Kudu tables from Spark.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_improvements"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_improvements">Improvements and optimizations</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1516">KUDU-1516</a> The <code>kudu-ksck</code> tool
has been improved and now detects problems such as when a tablet does not have
a majority of replicas on live tablet servers, or if those replicas aren’t in a
good state. Users who currently depend on the tool to detect inconsistencies may now see
failures when before they wouldn&#8217;t see any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3477">Gerrit #3477</a> The way operations are buffered in
the Java client has been reworked. Previously, the session&#8217;s buffer size was set per tablet, meaning that a buffer
size of 1,000 for 10 tablets being written to allowed for 10,000 operations to be buffered at the
same time. With this change, all the tablets share one buffer, so users might need to set a
bigger buffer size in order to reach the same level of performance as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3674/">Gerrit #3674</a> Added LESS and GREATER options for
column predicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1444">KUDU-1444</a> added support for passing
back basic per-scan metrics (e.g cache hit rate) from the server to the C++ client. See the
<code>KuduScanner::GetResourceMetrics()</code> API for detailed usage. This feature will be supported
in the Java client API in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1446">KUDU-1446</a> improved the order in
which the tablet server evaluates predicates, so that predicates on smaller columns
are evaluated first. This may improve performance on queries which apply predicates
on multiple columns of different sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398">KUDU-1398</a> improved the storage
efficiency of Kudu&#8217;s internal primary key indexes. This optimization should decrease space
usage and improve random access performance, particularly for workloads with lengthy
primary keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_fixed_issues"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_fixed_issues">Fixed Issues</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/">Gerrit #3541</a> Fixed a problem in the Java client
whereby an RPC could be dropped when a connection to a tablet server or master was forcefully
closed on the server-side while RPCs to that server were in the process of being encoded.
The effect was that the RPC would not be sent, and users of the synchronous API would receive
a <code>TimeoutException</code>. Several other Java client bugs which could cause similar spurious timeouts
were also fixed in this release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/<mark>/c/3724/">Gerrit #3724</a> Fixed a problem in the Java client
whereby an RPC could be dropped when a socket timeout was fired while that RPC was being sent to
a tablet server or master. This would manifest itself in the same way
<a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/</mark>/c/3541/">Gerrit #3541</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1538">KUDU-1538</a> fixed a bug in which recycled
block identifiers could cause the tablet server to lose data. Following this bug fix, block
identifiers will no longer be reused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_changes"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_changes">Other noteworthy changes</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is the first release of Apache Kudu as a top-level (non-incubating)
project!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default false positive rate for Bloom filters has been changed
from 1% to 0.01%. This will increase the space consumption of Bloom
filters by a factor of two (from approximately 10 bits per row to
approximately 20 bits per row). This is expected to substantially
improve the performance of random-write workloads at the cost of an
incremental increase in disk space usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kudu C++ client library now has Doxygen-based
<a href="http://kudu.apache.org/cpp-client-api/">API documentation</a>
available online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now
<a href="http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/17/raft-consensus-single-node.html">
uses the Raft consensus algorithm even for unreplicated tables</a>.
This change simplifies code and will also allow administrators to enable
replication on a previously-unreplicated table. This change is internal and
should not be visible to users.</p>

<p>To use Kudu with Impala, you must install a special release of Impala called
Impala_Kudu. Obtaining and installing a compatible Impala release is detailed in Kudu&#8217;s
<a href="kudu_impala_integration.html">Impala Integration</a> documentation.</p>
</li>

<p>To use Impala_Kudu alongside an existing Impala instance, you must install using parcels.</p>

<p>Updates, inserts, and deletes via Impala are non-transactional. If a query
fails part of the way through, its partial effects will not be rolled back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All queries will be distributed across all Impala hosts which host a replica
of the target table(s), even if a predicate on a primary key could correctly
restrict the query to a single tablet. This limits the maximum concurrency of
short queries made via Impala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No timestamp and decimal type support.</p>

<p>The maximum parallelism of a single query is limited to the number of tablets
in a table. For good analytic performance, aim for 10 or more tablets per host
or use large tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impala is only able to push down predicates involving <code>=</code>, <code>&#8656;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
or <code>BETWEEN</code> comparisons between any column and a literal value, and <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
for integer columns only. For example, for a table with an integer key <code>ts</code>, and
a string key <code>name</code>, the predicate <code>WHERE ts &gt;= 12345</code> will convert into an
efficient range scan, whereas <code>where name &gt; 'lipcon'</code> will currently fetch all

<p>The following are known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu. They will
be addressed in later beta releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the Kudu master is configured with the <code>-log_fsync_all</code> option, tablet servers
and clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become unusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes
to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 100 or fewer.
Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times,
you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web UI.</p>
