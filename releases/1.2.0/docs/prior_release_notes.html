<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Python client has been brought up to feature parity with the Java and C++ clients
and as such the package version will be brought to 1.1 with this release (from 0.3). A
list of the highlights can be found below.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved Partial Row semantics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Range partition support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scan Token API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced predicate support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for all Kudu data types (including a mapping of Python&#8217;s <code>datetime.datetime</code> to
<code>UNIXTIME_MICROS</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alter table support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabled Read at Snapshot for Scanners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabled Scanner Replica Selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few bug fixes for Python 3 in addition to various other improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>IN LIST predicate pushdown support was added to allow optimized execution of filters which
match on a set of column values. Support for Spark, Map Reduce and Impala queries utilizing
IN LIST pushdown is not yet complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client now features client-side request tracing in order to help troubleshoot timeouts.
Error messages are now augmented with traces that show which servers were contacted before the
timeout occured instead of just the last error. The traces also contain RPCs that were
required to fulfill the client&#8217;s request, such as contacting the master to discover a tablet&#8217;s
location. Note that the traces are not available for successful requests and are not
programatically queryable.</p>

<h2 id="_optimizations_and_improvements"><a class="link" href="#_optimizations_and_improvements">Optimizations and improvements</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu now publishes JAR files for Spark 2.0 compiled with Scala 2.11 along with the
existing Spark 1.6 JAR compiled with Scala 2.10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client now allows configuring scanners to read from the closest replica instead of
the known leader replica. The default remains the latter. Use the relevant <code>ReplicaSelection</code>
enum with the scanner&#8217;s builder to change this behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablet servers use a new policy for retaining write-ahead log (WAL) segments.
Previously, servers used the 'log_min_segments_to_retain' flag to prioritize
any flushes which were retaining log segments past the configured value (default 2).
This policy caused servers to flush in-memory data more frequently than necessary,
limiting write performance.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new policy introduces a new flag 'log_target_replay_size_mb' which
  determines the threshold at which write-ahead log retention will prioritize flushes.
  The new flag is considered experimental and users should not need to modify
  its value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improved policy has been seen to improve write performance in some use cases
  by a factor of 2x relative to the old policy.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu&#8217;s implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm has been improved to include
a "pre-election" phase. This can improve the stability of tablet leader election
in high-load scenarios, especially if each server hosts a high number of tablets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tablet server start-up time has been substantially improved in the case that
the server contains a high number of tombstoned tablet replicas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_command_line_tools"><a class="link" href="#_command_line_tools">Command line tools</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tool <code>kudu tablet leader_step_down</code> has been added to manually force a leader to step down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool <code>kudu remote_replica copy</code> has been added to manually copy a replica from
one running tablet server to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool <code>kudu local_replica delete</code> has been added to delete a replica of a tablet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>kudu test loadgen</code> tool has been added to replace the obsoleted
<code>insert-generated-rows</code> standalone binary. The new tool is enriched with
additional functionality and can be used to run load generation tests against
a Kudu cluster.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The C++ client no longer requires the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html">old gcc5 ABI</a>.
Which ABI is actually used depends on the compiler configuration. Some new distros
(e.g. Ubuntu 16.04) will use the new ABI. Your application must use the same ABI as is
used by the client library; an easy way to guarantee this is to use the same compiler
to build both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ client&#8217;s <code>KuduSession::CountBufferedOperations()</code> method is
deprecated. Its behavior is inconsistent unless the session runs in the
<code>MANUAL_FLUSH</code> mode. Instead, to get number of buffered operations, count
invocations of the <code>KuduSession::Apply()</code> method since last
<code>KuduSession::Flush()</code> call or, if using asynchronous flushing, since last
invocation of the callback passed into <code>KuduSession::FlushAsync()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s <code>OperationResponse.getWriteTimestamp</code> method was renamed to <code>getWriteTimestampRaw</code>
to emphasize that it doesn&#8217;t return milliseconds, unlike what its Javadoc indicated. The renamed
method was also hidden from the public APIs and should not be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s sync API (<code>KuduClient</code>, <code>KuduSession</code>, <code>KuduScanner</code>) used to throw either
a <code>NonRecoverableException</code> or a <code>TimeoutException</code> for a timeout, and now it&#8217;s only possible for the
client to throw the former.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s handling of errors in <code>KuduSession</code> was modified so that subclasses of
<code>KuduException</code> are converted into RowErrors instead of being thrown.</p>

<h2 id="rn_1.0.0"><a class="link" href="#rn_1.0.0">Release notes specific to 1.0.0</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After approximately a year of beta releases, Apache Kudu has reached version 1.0.
This version number signifies that the development team feels that Kudu is stable
enough for usage in production environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rn_1.0.0_new_features"><a class="link" href="#rn_1.0.0_new_features">New features</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu 1.0.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Removal of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) history is now supported.
This is known as tablet history GC. This allows Kudu to reclaim disk space,
where previously Kudu would keep a full history of all changes made to a
given table since the beginning of time. Previously, the only way to reclaim
disk space was to drop a table.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu will still keep historical data, and the amount of history retained is
  controlled by setting the configuration flag <code>--tablet_history_max_age_sec</code>,
  which defaults to 15 minutes (expressed in seconds). The timestamp
  represented by the current time minus <code>tablet_history_max_age_sec</code> is known
  as the ancient history mark (AHM). When a compaction or flush occurs, Kudu
  will remove the history of changes made prior to the ancient history mark.
  This only affects historical data; currently-visible data will not be
  removed. A specialized maintenance manager background task to remove existing
  "cold" historical data that is not in a row affected by the normal compaction
  process will be added in a future release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of Kudu&#8217;s command line tools have been consolidated under a new
top-level <code>kudu</code> tool. This reduces the number of large binaries distributed
with Kudu and also includes much-improved help output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kudu Flume Sink now supports processing events containing Avro-encoded
records, using the new <code>AvroKuduOperationsProducer</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative tools including <code>kudu cluster ksck</code> now support running
against multi-master Kudu clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output of the <code>ksck</code> tool is now colorized and much easier to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ client API now supports writing data in <code>AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND</code> mode.
This can provide higher throughput for ingest workloads.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_optimizations_and_improvements_2"><a class="link" href="#_optimizations_and_improvements_2">Optimizations and improvements</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The performance of comparison predicates on dictionary-encoded columns has
been substantially optimized. Users are encouraged to use dictionary encoding
on any string or binary columns with low cardinality, especially if these
columns will be filtered with predicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client is now able to prune partitions from scanners based on the
provided predicates. For example, an equality predicate on a hash-partitioned
column will now only access those tablets that could possibly contain matching
data. This is expected to improve performance for the Spark integration as well
as applications using the Java client API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of compaction selection in the tablet server has been
substantially improved. This can increase the efficiency of the background
maintenance threads and improve overall throughput of heavy write workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy by which the tablet server retains write-ahead log (WAL) files has
been improved so that it takes into account other replicas of the tablet.
This should help mitigate the spurious eviction of tablet replicas on machines
that temporarily lag behind the other replicas.</p>

<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes">Incompatible changes and deprecated APIs in 0.10.0</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3737">Gerrit #3737</a> The Java client has been repackaged
under <code>org.apache.kudu</code> instead of <code>org.kududb</code>. Import statements for Kudu classes must
be modified in order to compile against 0.10.0. Wire compatibility is maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/">Gerrit #3055</a> The Java client&#8217;s
synchronous API methods now throw <code>KuduException</code> instead of <code>Exception</code>.
Existing code that catches <code>Exception</code> should still compile, but introspection of an
exception&#8217;s message may be impacted. This change was made to allow thrown exceptions to be
queried more easily using <code>KuduException.getStatus</code> and calling one of <code>Status&#8217;s methods.
For example, an operation that tries to delete a table that doesn&#8217;t exist would return a
`Status</code> that returns true when queried on <code>isNotFound()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s <code>KuduTable.getTabletsLocations</code> set of methods is now
deprecated. Additionally, they now take an exclusive end partition key instead
of an inclusive key. Applications are encouraged to use the scan tokens API
instead of these methods in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C++ API for specifying split points on range-partitioned tables has been improved
to make it easier for callers to properly manage the ownership of the provided rows.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>TableCreator::split_rows</code> API took a <code>vector&lt;const KuduPartialRow*&gt;</code>, which
  made it very difficult for the calling application to do proper error handling with
  cleanup when setting the fields of the <code>KuduPartialRow</code>. This API has been now been
  deprecated and replaced by a new method <code>TableCreator::add_range_split</code> which allows
  easier use of smart pointers for safe memory management.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s internal buffering has been reworked. Previously, the number of
buffered write operations was constrained on a per-tablet-server basis. Now, the configured
maximum buffer size constrains the total number of buffered operations across all
tablet servers in the cluster. This provides a more consistent bound on the memory
usage of the client regardless of the size of the cluster to which it is writing.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This change can negatively affect the write performance of Java clients which rely on
  buffered writes. Consider using the <code>setMutationBufferSpace</code> API to increase a
  session&#8217;s maximum buffer size if write performance seems to be degraded after upgrading
  to Kudu 0.10.0.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "remote bootstrap" process used to copy a tablet replica from one host to
another has been renamed to "Tablet Copy". This resulted in the renaming of
several RPC metrics. Any users previously explicitly fetching or monitoring metrics
related to Remote Bootstrap should update their scripts to reflect the new names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SparkSQL datasource for Kudu no longer supports mode <code>Overwrite</code>. Users should
use the new <code>KuduContext.upsertRows</code> method instead. Additionally, inserts using the
datasource are now upserts by default. The older behavior can be restored by setting
the <code>operation</code> parameter to <code>insert</code>.</p>

<p>Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table.
When a table is created, the user may specify a set of range partitions that
do not cover the entire available key space. A user may add or drop range
partitions to existing tables.</p>

<p>This feature can be particularly helpful with time series workloads in which
  new partitions can be created on an hourly or daily basis. Old partitions
  may be efficiently dropped if the application does not need to retain historical
  data past a certain point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature is considered experimental for the 0.10 release. More details of
  the new feature can be found in the accompanying

<p>Support for running Kudu clusters with multiple masters has been stabilized.
Users may start a cluster with three or five masters to provide fault tolerance
despite a failure of one or two masters, respectively.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that certain tools (e.g. <code>ksck</code>) are still lacking complete support for
  multiple masters. These deficiencies will be addressed in a following release.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now supports the ability to reserve a certain amount of free disk space
in each of its configured data directories. If a directory&#8217;s free disk space
drops to less than the configured minimum, Kudu will stop writing to that
directory until space becomes available. If no space is available in any
configured directory, Kudu will abort.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature may be configured using the <code>fs_data_dirs_reserved_bytes</code> and
  <code>fs_wal_dir_reserved_bytes</code> flags.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spark integration&#8217;s <code>KuduContext</code> now supports four new methods for writing to
Kudu tables: <code>insertRows</code>, <code>upsertRows</code>, <code>updateRows</code>, and <code>deleteRows</code>. These are
now the preferred way to write to Kudu tables from Spark.</p>

<h3 id="rn_0.10.0_improvements"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.10.0_improvements">Improvements and optimizations</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1516">KUDU-1516</a> The <code>kudu-ksck</code> tool
has been improved and now detects problems such as when a tablet does not have
a majority of replicas on live tablet servers, or if those replicas aren’t in a
good state. Users who currently depend on the tool to detect inconsistencies may now see
failures when before they wouldn&#8217;t see any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3477">Gerrit #3477</a> The way operations are buffered in
the Java client has been reworked. Previously, the session&#8217;s buffer size was set per tablet, meaning that a buffer
size of 1,000 for 10 tablets being written to allowed for 10,000 operations to be buffered at the
same time. With this change, all the tablets share one buffer, so users might need to set a
bigger buffer size in order to reach the same level of performance as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3674/">Gerrit #3674</a> Added LESS and GREATER options for
column predicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1444">KUDU-1444</a> added support for passing
back basic per-scan metrics (e.g cache hit rate) from the server to the C++ client. See the
<code>KuduScanner::GetResourceMetrics()</code> API for detailed usage. This feature will be supported
in the Java client API in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1446">KUDU-1446</a> improved the order in
which the tablet server evaluates predicates, so that predicates on smaller columns
are evaluated first. This may improve performance on queries which apply predicates
on multiple columns of different sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398">KUDU-1398</a> improved the storage
efficiency of Kudu&#8217;s internal primary key indexes. This optimization should decrease space
usage and improve random access performance, particularly for workloads with lengthy
primary keys.</p>

<ul>

<p><a href="https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/">Gerrit #3541</a> Fixed a problem in the Java client
whereby an RPC could be dropped when a connection to a tablet server or master was forcefully
closed on the server-side while RPCs to that server were in the process of being encoded.
The effect was that the RPC would not be sent, and users of the synchronous API would receive
a <code>TimeoutException</code>. Several other Java client bugs which could cause similar spurious timeouts
were also fixed in this release.</p>

<p>The default false positive rate for Bloom filters has been changed
from 1% to 0.01%. This will increase the space consumption of Bloom
filters by a factor of two (from approximately 10 bits per row to
approximately 20 bits per row). This is expected to substantially
improve the performance of random-write workloads at the cost of an
incremental increase in disk space usage.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>With the goal of Spark integration in mind, a new <code>kuduRDD</code> API has been added,
which wraps <code>newAPIHadoopRDD</code> and includes a default source for Spark SQL.</p>

<h3 id="rn_0.7.0_improvements"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.7.0_improvements">Improvements</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Java client includes new methods <code>countPendingErrors()</code> and
<code>getPendingErrors()</code> on <code>KuduSession</code>. These methods allow you to count and
retrieve outstanding row errors when configuring sessions with <code>AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New server-level metrics allow you to monitor CPU usage and context switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now builds on RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SLES 12. Extra instructions are included
for SLES 12.</p>

<p><a href="https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1288">KUDU-1288</a> fixes a severe file descriptor
leak, which could previously only be resolved by restarting the tablet server.</p>

<h3 id="rn_0.7.0_changes"><a class="link" href="#rn_0.7.0_changes">Other noteworthy changes</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The file block manager&#8217;s performance was improved, but it is still not recommended for
real-world use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The master now attempts to spread tablets more evenly across the cluster during
table creation. This has no impact on existing tables, but will improve the speed
at which under-replicated tabletsare re-replicated after a tablet server failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All licensing documents have been modified to adhere to ASF guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu now requires an out-of-tree build directory. Review the build instructions
for additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>C` client library is now explicitly built against the
link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc/manual/using_dual_abi.html[old gcc5 ABI].
If you use gcc5 to build a Kudu application, your application must use the old ABI
as well. This is typically achieved by defining the `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI</code> macro
at compile-time when building your application. For more information, see the
previous link and link:http://developerblog.redhat.com/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Python client is no longer considered experimental.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 0.6.0 release contains incremental improvements and bug fixes. The most notable
changes are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s CreateTableBuilder and AlterTableBuilder classes have been renamed
to CreateTableOptions and AlterTableOptions. Their methods now also return <code>this</code> objects,
allowing them to be used as builders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client&#8217;s AbstractKuduScannerBuilder#maxNumBytes() setter is now called
batchSizeBytes as is the corresponding property in AsyncKuduScanner. This makes it
consistent with the C++ client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "kudu-admin" tool can now list and delete tables via its new subcommands
"list_tables" and "delete_table &lt;table_name&gt;".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OSX is now supported for single-host development. Please consult its specific installation
instructions in <a href="installation.html#osx_from_source">OS X</a>.</p>
