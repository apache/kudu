<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu includes security features which allow Kudu clusters to be hardened against
access from unauthorized users. This guide describes the security features
provided by Kudu. <a href="#configuration">Configuring a Secure Kudu Cluster</a> lists essential configuration options when
deploying a secure Kudu cluster. <a href="#known-limitations">Known Limitations</a> contains a list of
known deficiencies in Kudu&#8217;s security capabilities.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_authentication"><a class="link" href="#_authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu can be configured to enforce secure authentication among servers, and
between clients and servers. Authentication prevents untrusted actors from
gaining access to Kudu, and securely identifies the connecting user or services
for authorization checks. Authentication in Kudu is designed to interoperate
with other secure Hadoop components by utilizing Kerberos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication can be configured on Kudu servers using the
<code>--rpc_authentication</code> flag, which can be set to <code>required</code>, <code>optional</code>, or
<code>disabled</code>. By default, the flag is set to <code>optional</code>. When <code>required</code>, Kudu
will reject connections from clients and servers who lack authentication
credentials. When <code>optional</code>, Kudu will attempt to use strong authentication.
When <code>disabled</code> or strong authentication fails for 'optional', by default Kudu
will only allow unauthenticated connections from trusted subnets, which are
private networks (127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16,
169.254.0.0/16) and local subnets of all local network interfaces. Unauthenticated
connections from publicly routable IPs will be rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trusted subnets can be configured using the <code>--trusted_subnets</code> flag,
which can be set to IP blocks in CIDR notation separated by comma. Set it to
'0.0.0.0/0' to allow unauthenticated connections from all remote IP addresses.
However, if network access is not otherwise restricted by a firewall,
malicious users may be able to gain unauthorized access. This can be mitigated
if authentication is configured to be required.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internal_pki"><a class="link" href="#_internal_pki">Internal PKI</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu uses an internal PKI system to issue X.509 certificates to servers in
the cluster. Connections between peers who have both obtained certificates will
use TLS for authentication, which doesn&#8217;t require contacting the Kerberos KDC.
These certificates are <em>only</em> used for internal communication among Kudu
servers, and between Kudu clients and servers. The certificates are never
presented in a public facing protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using internally-issued certificates, Kudu offers strong authentication which
scales to huge clusters, and allows TLS encryption to be used without requiring
you to manually deploy certificates on every node.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_authentication_tokens"><a class="link" href="#_authentication_tokens">Authentication Tokens</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After authenticating to a secure cluster, the Kudu client will automatically
request an authentication token from the Kudu master. An authentication token
encapsulates the identity of the authenticated user and carries the master&#8217;s
RSA signature so that its authenticity can be verified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This token will be used to authenticate subsequent connections. By default,
authentication tokens are only valid for seven days, so that even if a token
were compromised, it could not be used indefinitely. For the most part,
authentication tokens should be completely transparent to users. By using
authentication tokens, Kudu takes advantage of strong authentication without
paying the scalability cost of communicating with a central authority for every
connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When used with distributed compute frameworks such as Spark, authentication
tokens can simplify configuration and improve security. For example, the Kudu
Spark connector will automatically retrieve an authentication token during the
planning stage, and distribute the token to tasks. This allows Spark to work
against a secured Kudu cluster where only the planner node has Kerberos
credentials.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_client_authentication_to_secure_kudu_clusters"><a class="link" href="#_client_authentication_to_secure_kudu_clusters">Client Authentication to Secure Kudu Clusters</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users running client Kudu applications must first run the <code>kinit</code> command to
obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ kinit admin@EXAMPLE-REALM.COM</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once authenticated, you use the same client code to read from and write to Kudu
servers with and without Kerberos configuration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scalability"><a class="link" href="#_scalability">Scalability</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu authentication is designed to scale to thousands of nodes, which requires
avoiding unnecessary coordination with a central authentication authority (such
as the Kerberos KDC). Instead, Kudu servers and clients will use Kerberos to
establish initial trust with the Kudu master, and then use alternate credentials
for subsequent connections. In particular, the master will issue internal
X.509 certificates to servers, and temporary authentication tokens to clients.</p>

<h2 id="_coarse_grained_authorization"><a class="link" href="#_coarse_grained_authorization">Coarse-Grained Authorization</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kudu supports coarse-grained authorization of client requests based on the
authenticated client Kerberos principal (i.e. user or service). The two levels
of access which can be configured are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Superuser</strong> - principals authorized as a superuser are able to perform
certain administrative functionality such as using the <code>kudu</code> command line tool
to diagnose or repair cluster issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User</strong> - principals authorized as a user are able to access and modify all
data in the Kudu cluster. This includes the ability to create, drop, and alter
tables as well as read, insert, update, and delete data.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Internally, Kudu has a third access level for the daemons themselves.

servers.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access levels are granted using whitelist-style Access Control Lists (ACLs), one
for each of the two levels. Each access control list either specifies a
comma-separated list of users, or may be set to <code>*</code> to indicate that all
authenticated users are able to gain access at the specified level. See
<a href="#configuration">Configuring a Secure Kudu Cluster</a> below for examples.</p>

The default value for the User ACL is <code>*</code>, which allows all users access
to the cluster. However, if authentication is enabled, this still restricts access
to only those users who are able to successfully authenticate via Kerberos.
Unauthenticated users on the same network as the Kudu servers will be unable
to access the cluster.

<p>As of Kudu 1.12.0, Kudu can be configured to enforce fine-grained authorization
across servers. This ensures that users can see only the data they are
explicitly authorized to see. Kudu supports this by leveraging policies defined

Fine-grained authorization policies are not enforced when accessing

Ranger allows you to add separate service repositories to manage privileges
for different Kudu clusters. Depending on the value of the <code>ranger.plugin.kudu.service.name</code>
configuration in Ranger client, Kudu knows which service repository to connect
to. For more details about Ranger service repository, see the Apache Ranger
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=57901344">documentation</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Database</strong> - Kudu does not have the concept of a database. Therefore, a database
is indicated as a prefix of table names with the format <code>&lt;database&gt;.&lt;table&gt;</code>.
Since Kudu&#8217;s only restriction on table names is that they be valid UTF-8 encoded
strings, Kudu considers special characters to be valid parts of database or table
names. For example, if a managed Kudu table created from Impala (see Kudu Impala
integration <a href="kudu_impala_integration.html#managed_tables">documentation</a>) is named
<code>impala::bar.foo</code>, its database will be <code>impala::bar</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Table</strong> - a single Kudu table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Column</strong> - a column within a Kudu table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Ranger, privileges are also associated with specific actions. Access to Kudu
tables may rely on privileges on the following actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ALTER</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CREATE</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DELETE</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DROP</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>INSERT</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>UPDATE</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>SELECT</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two additional access types:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ALL</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>METADATA</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a user has the <code>ALL</code> privilege on a resource, they implicitly have privileges
to perform any action on that resource (except those that require users to be a
delegated admin, see below). Also, if a user is granted any privilege, they are
able to perform actions requiring <code>METADATA</code> (e.g. opening the table) without
having to explicitly grant <code>METADATA</code> privilege to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Ranger supports a <code>delegate admin</code> flag which is independent of the
action types (it&#8217;s not implied by <code>ALL</code> and doesn&#8217;t imply <code>METADATA</code>). This is
similar to the <code>GRANT OPTION</code> part of <code>ALL WITH GRANT OPTION</code> in SQL as it is
required to modify privileges in Ranger and change the owner of a Kudu table.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
A user with the <code>delegate admin</code> privilege on a resource can grant any
privilege to themselves and others.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the action types are hierarchical, in terms of privilege evaluation,
Ranger doesn&#8217;t have the concept of hierarchy. For instance, if a user has
<code>SELECT</code> privilege on a database, it does not imply that the user has <code>SELECT</code>
privileges on every table belonging to that database. On the other hand, Ranger
supports privilege wildcard matching. For example, <code>db=a&#8594;table=*</code> matches all
the tables that belong to database <code>a</code>. Therefore, in Ranger users actually need
the <code>SELECT</code> privilege granted on <code>db=a&#8594;table=*&#8594;column=*</code> to allow <code>SELECT</code> on
every table and every column in database <code>a</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, with Ranger integration, when a Kudu master receives a request,
it consults Ranger to determine what privileges a user has. And the required
policies documented in the <a href="#policy-for-kudu-masters">policy section</a>
are enforced to determine whether the user is authorized to perform the requested
action or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Even though Kudu table names remain case sensitive with Ranger integration,
policy authorization is considered case-insensitive.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to granting privileges to a user by username, privileges can also be
granted to table owners using the special <code>{OWNER}</code> username. These policies are
evaluated only when a user tries to perform an action on a table that they own.
For example, a policy can be defined for the <code>{OWNER}</code> user and <code>db=<strong>&#8594;table=</strong></code>
resource, and it will automatically be applied when any table is accessed by its
owner. This way administrators don&#8217;t need to choose between creating policies
one by one for each table, and granting access to a wide range of users.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_authorization_tokens"><a class="link" href="#_authorization_tokens">Authorization Tokens</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than having every tablet server communicate directly with the underlying
authorization service (Ranger), privileges are propagated and checked via
<strong>authorization tokens</strong>. These tokens encapsulate what privileges a user has on a
given table. Tokens are generated by the master and returned to Kudu clients
upon opening a Kudu table. Kudu clients automatically attach authorization
tokens when sending requests to tablet servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Authorization tokens are a means to limiting the number of nodes directly
accessing the authorization service to retrieve privileges. As such, since the
expected number of tablet servers in a cluster is much higher than the number of
Kudu masters, they are only used to authorize requests sent to tablet servers.
Kudu masters fetch privileges directly from the authorization service or cache.
See <a href="#privilege-caching">Ranger Client Caching</a> for more details of Kudu&#8217;s privilege cache.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to the validity interval for authentication tokens, to limit the
window of potential unwanted access if a token becomes compromised,
authorization tokens are valid for five minutes by default. The acquisition and
renewal of a token is hidden from the user, as Kudu clients automatically
retrieve new tokens when existing tokens expire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a tablet server that has been configured to enforce fine-grained access
control receives a request, it checks the privileges in the attached token,
rejecting it if the privileges are not sufficient to perform the requested
operation, or if it is invalid (e.g. expired).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trusted-users"><a class="link" href="#trusted-users">Trusted Users</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may be desirable to allow certain users to view and modify any data stored
in Kudu. Such users can be specified via the <code>--trusted_user_acl</code> master
configuration. Trusted users can perform any operation that would otherwise
require fine-grained privileges, without Kudu consulting the authorization service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, some services that interact with Kudu may authorize requests on
behalf of their end users. For example, Apache Impala authorizes queries on
behalf of its users, and sends requests to Kudu as the Impala service user,
commonly "impala". Since Impala authorizes requests on its own, to avoid
extraneous communication between the authorization service and Kudu, the
Impala service user should be listed as a trusted user.</p>
